XMPPSERVER %|[-ssl] [-server <host>] [-port <port>] <jid>[/<resource] [<password>]

     -ssl: use SSL when connecting (deprecated, StartTLS will be used by default if this parameter is not specified)
     -host: the host
     -port: the port (if not specified, 5222 is used for a normal connection or 5223 for an SSL connection)

This command disconnects the server in active window and connects to the new one. It will take the same arguments as /XMPPCONNECT.
